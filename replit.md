# Mafia Game Website

## Overview

This is a self-hosted online implementation of the party game Mafia, built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application supports multiple game phases including lobby management, town naming, role assignment, night/day cycles, voting, and game resolution. It's designed to handle real-time multiplayer gameplay with a focus on smooth user experience and reliable state management.

**Current Status**: Core lobby functionality is complete and tested. Players can create games with 4-letter codes, join lobbies, add test players for development, and successfully start games. The system transitions properly between game phases and supports both host-driven and player-voting town naming modes.

## Key Components

### Game State Management
- **Game Phases**: Lobby â†’ Town Naming â†’ Role Assignment â†’ Night/Day Cycles â†’ Voting â†’ Game End
- **Player Management**: Real-time connection status tracking, host privileges, and role assignments
- **Action System**: Type-safe game actions with phase-specific validation
- **State Synchronization**: Polling-based updates every 2 seconds for real-time feel

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Player Identification**: UUID-based player IDs stored in localStorage
- **Host Privileges**: First player to create a game becomes host with special permissions
- **Game Access**: 4-letter game codes for joining games
- **No Traditional Auth**: Simplified flow without user accounts or passwords

### UI/UX Components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Real-time Updates**: Live connection status indicators and game state polling
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support via Radix UI
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for actions and errors
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components and loading indicators

### Game Logic Implementation
- **Role Assignment**: Dynamic role distribution based on player count
- **Voting System**: Majority-based elimination with tie-breaking
- **Night Actions**: Role-specific abilities (Sheriff investigate, Doctor heal, etc.)
- **Win Conditions**: Town vs Mafia vs Neutral role victory conditions
- **Timer System**: Configurable time limits for phases

## Data Flow

### Game Creation Flow
1. Host creates game â†’ generates 4-letter code â†’ receives host privileges
2. Players join via code â†’ real-time player list updates
3. Host configures town naming mode â†’ starts game
4. System assigns roles randomly â†’ game phases begin

### Game Phase Flow
1. **Town Naming**: Players submit suggestions â†’ voting on favorites
2. **Role Assignment**: Display roles to players â†’ confirmation to proceed
3. **Night Phase**: Role-specific actions â†’ all actions submitted
4. **Day Phase**: Discussion period â†’ player nomination
5. **Voting Phase**: Yes/no votes on nominated player â†’ execution/pardon
6. **Win Check**: Evaluate victory conditions â†’ continue or end game

### Data Persistence Flow
- Client actions â†’ API endpoints â†’ validation â†’ database updates
- Database changes â†’ next polling cycle â†’ client state updates
- Error handling â†’ toast notifications â†’ user feedback

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies

- **Static Files**: Express serves built frontend from `/dist/public`
- **Process Management**: Simple node process execution with environment variables

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite HMR for frontend, TSX watch mode for backend
- **Database**: Same Neon Database instance with separate schemas/tables
- **CORS**: Development middleware for cross-origin requests
- **Logging**: Custom request logging with performance metrics

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: Required PostgreSQL connection string
