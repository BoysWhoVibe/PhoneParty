# Mafia Game Website

## Overview

This is a self-hosted online implementation of the party game Mafia, built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application supports multiple game phases including lobby management, town naming, role assignment, night/day cycles, voting, and game resolution. It's designed to handle real-time multiplayer gameplay with a focus on smooth user experience and reliable state management.

**Current Status**: Core lobby functionality is complete and tested. Players can create games with 4-letter codes, join lobbies, add test players for development, and successfully start games. The system transitions properly between game phases and supports both host-driven and player-voting town naming modes.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Development approach: Make the website as personal as possible - gameplay mechanics (role assignment, voting, etc.) should only come from user's ideas and the attached game specification document. Technical implementation choices remain at developer's discretion.
UI/UX Standard: All text input fields across all game phases should support Enter key submission in addition to button clicks.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: In-memory storage with fallback to database persistence
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript-first schema definitions
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage class for rapid development
- **Session Storage**: Custom implementation supporting both memory and database backends

## Key Components

### Game State Management
- **Game Phases**: Lobby → Town Naming → Role Assignment → Night/Day Cycles → Voting → Game End
- **Player Management**: Real-time connection status tracking, host privileges, and role assignments
- **Action System**: Type-safe game actions with phase-specific validation
- **State Synchronization**: Polling-based updates every 2 seconds for real-time feel

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Player Identification**: UUID-based player IDs stored in localStorage
- **Host Privileges**: First player to create a game becomes host with special permissions
- **Game Access**: 4-letter game codes for joining games
- **No Traditional Auth**: Simplified flow without user accounts or passwords

### UI/UX Components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Real-time Updates**: Live connection status indicators and game state polling
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support via Radix UI
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for actions and errors
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components and loading indicators

### Game Logic Implementation
- **Role Assignment**: Dynamic role distribution based on player count
- **Voting System**: Majority-based elimination with tie-breaking
- **Night Actions**: Role-specific abilities (Sheriff investigate, Doctor heal, etc.)
- **Win Conditions**: Town vs Mafia vs Neutral role victory conditions
- **Timer System**: Configurable time limits for phases

## Data Flow

### Game Creation Flow
1. Host creates game → generates 4-letter code → receives host privileges
2. Players join via code → real-time player list updates
3. Host configures town naming mode → starts game
4. System assigns roles randomly → game phases begin

### Game Phase Flow
1. **Town Naming**: Players submit suggestions → voting on favorites
2. **Role Assignment**: Display roles to players → confirmation to proceed
3. **Night Phase**: Role-specific actions → all actions submitted
4. **Day Phase**: Discussion period → player nomination
5. **Voting Phase**: Yes/no votes on nominated player → execution/pardon
6. **Win Check**: Evaluate victory conditions → continue or end game

### Data Persistence Flow
- Client actions → API endpoints → validation → database updates
- Database changes → next polling cycle → client state updates
- Error handling → toast notifications → user feedback
