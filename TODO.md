# Mafia Game - Development TODO List

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Core Game Infrastructure
- [x] Game room creation with unique 4-letter codes
- [x] Player joining and name validation
- [x] Host identification system (player who created the room)
- [x] Real-time game state management
- [x] Phase transitions (lobby ‚Üí role-assignment ‚Üí gameplay)

### Role Assignment System
- [x] Random role distribution for 3+ players
- [x] Role acknowledgment requirement before gameplay
- [x] Host controls for progression after all acknowledge
- [x] Proper waiting messages for non-host players
- [x] "Waiting for host to start the game" message implementation

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] **Automated API integration tests** (eliminates manual multi-tab testing)
- [x] Comprehensive game flow validation using curl commands
- [x] Browser-based end-to-end tests using Playwright
- [x] Intelligent test runner with environment detection
- [x] Error handling and edge case validation
- [x] Test data attributes added to UI components

### User Experience
- [x] Mobile-responsive design
- [x] Enter key support for all text input fields
- [x] Loading states and user feedback
- [x] Connection status monitoring
- [x] Simple, everyday language in UI

## üöß In Progress

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Database optimizations for concurrent games
- [ ] WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- [ ] Caching strategies for game state
- [ ] Load testing with 8+ player games

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit tests for game logic functions
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Security testing and input validation

### Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and logging system
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## üìù Notes

### Recent Achievement: Automated Testing
The implementation of comprehensive automated testing is a major milestone that:
- Eliminates the need for manual testing with multiple browser tabs
- Provides instant validation of complete game flows
- Ensures regression prevention during development
- Validates API endpoints, error handling, and user experience
- Supports both development and deployment confidence

### Architecture Decisions
- Host identification: Player who created the room maintains host privileges throughout
- Role acknowledgment: Required from all players before gameplay begins
- Phase progression: Host controls advancement after acknowledgment completion
- Testing strategy: API-first validation with browser test fallback
